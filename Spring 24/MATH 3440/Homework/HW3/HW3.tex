\noindent\textbf{Question:} 
Explain why the coefficient of $ x^5y^3 $ is the same as the coefficient of $ x^3y^5 $ in the expansion of $ {(x + y)}^8 $?

\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 

In the binomial expansion of $ {(x + y)}^n $, we use $ \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^k $. When expanding $ {(x + y)}^{8} $, the coefficients of the terms $ x^5y^3 $ and $ x^3y^5 $ are determined by the binomial coefficients $ \binom{8}{3} $ and $ \binom{8}{5} $ respectively.

The binomial coefficient $ \binom{n}{k} $ is equal to $ \binom{n}{n-k} $, so in our example $ \binom{8}{3} = \binom{8}{8-3} = \binom{8}{5} $. This property explains why the coefficients of $ x^5y^3 $ and $ x^3y^5 $ are the same in the expansion of $ {(x + y)}^8 $.

\noindent\textbf{Question:} 



In an attempt to clean up your room, you have purchased a new floating shelf to put some of your 17 books you have stacked in a corner. These books are all by different authors. The new book shelf is large enough to hold 10 of the books.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]How many ways can you select and arrange 10 of the 17 books on the shelf? Notice that here we will allow the books to end up in any order. Explain.

    \item[b.]How many ways can you arrange 10 of the 17 books on the shelf if you insist they must be arranged alphabetically by author? Explain.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 
\begin{enumerate}

\item[a.]The number of ways to select and arrange 10 out of the 17 books on the shelf, where the order matters.
\[
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
\]
For our case where \( n = 17 \) and \( r = 10 \):
\[
P(17, 10) = \frac{17!}{(17-10)!} = \frac{17!}{7!}
\]

\item[b.]When the books are arranged alphabetically by author, the order of selection is not important.
\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
For selecting 10 books out of 17, this becomes:
\[
C(17, 10) = \frac{17!}{10! * 7!}
\]

\noindent\textbf{Question:} 
We have seen that the formula for is
.

Your task here is to explain why this is the right formula.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.]Suppose you have 12 chips, each a different color. How many different stacks of 5 chips can you make? Explain your answer and why it is the same as using the formula for $P(12,5)$.

\item[b.]Using the scenario of the 12 chips again, what does $12!$ count? What does $7!$ count? Explain.

\item[c.]Explain why it makes sense to divide $12!$ by $7!$ when computing (in terms of the chips).

\item[d.]Does your explanation work for numbers other than 12 and 5? Explain the formula $P(n,k)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
using the variables $n$ and $k$
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 
\begin{enumerate}

\item[a.]Consider having 12 chips, each a different color. To determine the number of different stacks of 5 chips you can make, we use \( P(12, 5) \). This is because we are selecting 5 chips out of 12 and the order in which we select the chips matters (since each stack can have a different order of colors).

\[ P(12, 5) = \frac{12!}{(12-5)!} = \frac{12!}{7!} \]

\item[b.]In the context of the 12 chips:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( 12! \) is the total number of ways to arrange all 12 chips.
    \item \( 7! \) is the number of ways to arrange the 7 chips that are not selected in our stack of 5.
\end{itemize}
Thus, \( 12! \) gives us all the possible arrangements, and by dividing by \( 7! \), we exclude the arrangements of the 7 chips we do not pick, focusing solely on the permutations of the 5 chosen chips.

\item[c.]
Dividing \( 12! \) by \( 7! \) makes sense as it cancels out the the chips not in the stack of 5. This leaves us with the number of unique arrangements for the selected 5 chips.

\item[d.]This holds for any values of \( n \) and \( k \). For any calculation \( P(n, k) \), \( n! \) provides the total number of arrangements of \( n \) objects, and \( (n-k)! \) eliminates the orderings of the \( n-k \) objects not chosen, giving the correct number of permutations for the chosen objects.

\section*{Exercise 2 1.4}  


Suppose you own \( x \) fezzes and \( y \) bow ties. Of course, \( x \) and \( y \) are both greater than 1.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many combinations of fez and bow tie can you make? You can wear only one fez and one bow tie at a time. Explain.
    \item Explain why the answer is also \( \binom{x+y}{2} - \binom{x}{2} - \binom{y}{2} \). (If this is what you claimed the answer was in part (a), try it again.)
    \item Use your answers to parts (a) and (b) to give a combinatorial proof of the identity
    \[
    \binom{x + y}{2} - \left( \binom{x}{2} + \binom{y}{2} \right) = xy .
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 
\vspace{0.2cm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] For each fez, you can pair it with any bow tie. This gives $x$ number of fezzes $*$ $y$ number of bow ties ($x*y$)
    \item[b.] The expression given represents the number of ways to choose 2 items out of $x+y$ items, but then subtacting the combinations where both selected items are fezzes and where both selected items are bow ties. By subtracting these, we are left with only the selections of one fez and one bow tie.
    \item[c.] 
    $\binom{x + y}{2}$ represents all the ways of picking 2 items from a set of $x+y$

    $\binom{x}{2}$ represents all the ways of picking 2 items from $x$

    $\binom{y}{2}$ represents all the ways of picking 2 items from $y$

    When we subtract the last 2 from the first, we are left with the number of ways to pick one item $x$ and one item $y$.

How many triangles can you draw using the dots below as vertices?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] Find an expression for the answer which is the sum of three terms involving binomial coefficients.
    \item[b.] Find an expression for the answer which is the difference of two binomial coefficients.
    \item[c.] Generalize the above to state and prove a binomial identity using a combinatorial proof. Say you have \( z \) points on the horizontal axis and \( y \) points in the semi-circle.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] $\binom{5}{3}+\binom{7}{1}*\binom{5}{2}+\binom{7}{2}*\binom{5}{1}$
    \item[b.] I'm not sure I understand this one completly.

    \[
        \binom{y}{3} + \binom{z}{1} \cdot \binom{y}{2} + \binom{z}{2} \cdot \binom{y}{1}
    \]
    This expression represents the total number of triangles that can be formed when choosing points from the two sets. Each term accounts for different scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \binom{y}{3} \) counts the triangles formed by choosing all three points from the \( y \) points in the semi-circle.
    \item \( \binom{z}{1} \cdot \binom{y}{2} \) counts the triangles with one vertex from the \( z \) points on the horizontal axis and the other two vertices from the \( y \) points in the semi-circle.
    \item \( \binom{z}{2} \cdot \binom{y}{1} \) counts the triangles with two vertices from the \( z \) points on the horizontal axis and one vertex from the \( y \) points in the semi-circle.

\section*{Exercise 6 1.4}  

Consider the identity:
\[
k \binom{n}{k} = n \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] Is this true? Try it for a few values of \( n \) and \( k \).
    \item[b.] Use the formula for \( \binom{n}{k} \) to give an algebraic proof of the identity.
    \item[c.] Give a combinatorial proof of the identity.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 
\vspace{0.2cm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] \[6 \binom{15}{6} = 15 \binom{14}{5}\]\[6(5005)=15(3003)\]\[30030=30030\] Given this, we find that the identity holds true.
    \item[b.] Using the formula for binomial coefficients, we have:
    \begin{align*}
    k \binom{n}{k} &= k \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} = \frac{n!}{(k - 1)!(n - k)!} \\
    n \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} &= n \frac{(n - 1)!}{(k - 1)!((n - 1) - (k - 1))!} = \frac{n!}{(k - 1)!(n - k)!}
    \end{align*}
    Thus, the identity is proved algebraically since both sides are equal
    \item[c.] Combinatorially, the identity can be proved by considering the set of combinations of choosing \( k \) elements out of \( n \) with a specific element included. Both expressions count the same number of such combinations.

\section*{Exercise 9 1.4}  

Give a combinatorial proof for the identity 
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \binom{n+1}{2}.
\]

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{Right Side:} The right side, \( \binom{n+1}{2} \), counts the number of ways to select 2 distinct elements from a set of \( n+1 \) elements.

\textbf{Left Side:} For the left side, consider selecting a pair from \( n+1 \) elements by fixing the first element and varying the second. There are \( n \) ways to pair the first element, \( n-1 \) ways to pair the second element, and so on, down to 1 way to pair the second-to-last element.


Thus, the sum \( 1 + 2 + \cdots + n \) accounts for all ways to form such pairs, where each pair is counted once. Since both sides count the same set of pairs, the identity is proved combinatorially.

Let's count \textit{ternary} digit strings, that is, strings in which each digit can be 0, 1, or 2.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] How many ternary digit strings contain exactly \( n \) digits?
    \item[(b)] How many ternary digit strings contain exactly \( n \) digits and \( n \) 2's.
    \item[(c)] How many ternary digit strings contain exactly \( n \) digits and \( n - 1 \) 2's. (Hint: where can you put the non-2 digit, and then what could it be?)
    \item[(d)] How many ternary digit strings contain exactly \( n \) digits and \( n - 2 \) 2's. (Hint: see previous hint)
    \item[(e)] How many ternary digit strings contain exactly \( n \) digits and \( n - k \) 2's.

    \binom{n}{0} + 2\binom{n}{1} + 2^2\binom{n}{2} + 2^3\binom{n}{3} + \cdots + 2^n\binom{n}{n} = 3^n.
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 
\vspace{0.2cm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] There are \( 3^n \) ternary digit strings of length \( n \) because each digit can be chosen in 3 ways (0, 1, or 2).
    \item[(b)] There is only 1 ternary digit string that contains exactly \( n \) digits and all are 2's.
    \item[(c)] There are \( 2n \) ternary digit strings with \( n - 1 \) 2's because the non-2 digit (0 or 1) can be placed in any of the \( n \) positions.
    \item[(d)] There are \( 3 \binom{n}{2} \) ternary digit strings with \( n - 2 \) 2's because the two non-2 digits can be 00, 01, or 11, and they can be placed in any two of the \( n \) positions.
    \item[(e)] There are \( 2^k \binom{n}{k} \) ternary digit strings with \( n - k \) 2's because the \( k \) non-2 digits can be any combination of 0's and 1's, placed in any \( k \) of the \( n \) positions.
    \item[(f)] There are \( 2^n \) ternary digit strings with no 2's because each digit can either be 0 or 1.
    \item[(g)] The given identity can be proved combinatorially by observing that each term in the sum counts the ternary strings with a fixed number of 2's, and all possible combinations of 0's and 1's for the remaining digits. Since a ternary string can have between 0 and \( n \) digits being 2, the sum of all such possibilities must account for all \( 3^n \) ternary strings.

\section*{Exercise 14 1.4}  

In Example 1.4.5 we established that the sum of any row in Pascal's triangle is a power of two. Specifically,
\[
\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} + \cdots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n.
\]
The argument given there used the counting question, ``how many pizzas can you build using any number of \( n \) different toppings''? To practice, give new proofs of this identity using different questions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] Use a question about counting subsets.
    \item[b.] Use a question about counting bit strings.
    \item[c.] Use a question about counting lattice paths.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\textbf{Solution Draft:} 
\vspace{0.2cm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] For a set with \( n \) elements, the total number of subsets is \( 2^n \). Each subset corresponds to a choice of 0 to \( n \) elements, counted by the sum of binomial coefficients, which gives a combinatorial proof of the identity.
    \item[c.] A bit string of length \( n \) has \( 2^n \) configurations. Each configuration is counted by the number of 1's it contains, which ranges from 0 to \( n \), thus the sum of the binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{k} \) from 0 to \( n \) gives the total count, providing a combinatorial proof
    \item[(c)] The number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,0) with steps that go right or up-then-down is \( 2^n \). Each path is uniquely determined by the positions of the up-then-down steps among the \( n \) steps. The number of ways to choose the positions for \( k \) up-then-down steps is \( \binom{n}{k} \), and summing this from \( k = 0 \) to \( n \) accounts for all such lattice paths. This sum is equal to the total number of paths, which gives a combinatorial proof of the identity \( \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \cdots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n \).
